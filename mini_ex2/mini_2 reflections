My coding proces: 
My proces has been a learning proces, more than a focused proces towards creating a cartoon/graffic expressing 
an error etc. Of couse my main goal was to meet the requirements of the assignment, but in doing this I dived 
into p5.js and its many functions which led to a lot of experimentation, errors and progress. 

But to mention my actual work I was hoping to create something which did not look too newbie programmer ish. 
To some extent I think that I have succeeded in doing this, but my skill level is of course showing. 
I was aiming for implementing moving object, objects disappearing/showing, variables, text, if-statements and music. 
Unfortunately I had to admit defeat (a very painful one...) with the music.
On the basis of my failed attempt to implement music I found a way to add an error to my graffic. As you probably have experienced by now, the program shows a 'Error (404): Not Found' page, when 'enter' is pressed; right when you want to hear that funky music (damn). 

So what constitutes a program...?
- Code (and a language (js, python etc))
- A programmer... 
- A computer/smartphone/tablet/car etc where the code is manifested/doing its magic
- A user is able to perform action(s)
- Different actions is taking place (activated by user/system)

Behind every strong program stands some powerful code... I guess that the word 'program' is the term used as a 'simplified' description of what the underlying code is actually doing. 

ERRORS !! and reflections: 
I would say that, within programming, an error is (or can be) a springboard to improvement or maybe just changing the expected outcome (as my error did), and by that the system gets a voice.
